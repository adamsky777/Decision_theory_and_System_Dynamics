#### _"Effective management in complex systems requires understanding feedback loops and iterating on mental models for better decision-making."_

## About the course

> This course introduces students to system dynamics as a tool for analyzing and modeling complex problems and strategies in both society (at large) and businesses. 
> As such, system dynamics enables understanding the structure and dynamics of complex systems. 
> System dynamics is also a rigorous modeling method for developing formal computer simulations of complex systems and use these simulations to design more effective policies and make better decisions. 
> These simulation models can be used to create management flight simulators: microworlds where space and time can be compressed and slowed so decision makers can experience the long-term side effects of decisions, speed learning, develop our understanding of complex systems, and design structures and strategies for greater success (Sterman, 2000, pp. vii).


## Learning Outcomes:


> * Develop simulation models of (business) systems
> * Simulate what-if scenarios, and use these scenarios to develop better and more sustainable policies.
> * Translate a problem description into a conceptual or qualitative model.
> * Translate the conceptual model into mathematical equations.
> * Develop a simulation model, learning to use Vensim Ventana System's software.
> * Translate quantitative, simulation results into sustainable “best practices” for management in a stylized company project (case study).
> * Be able to explain how the structure of (business) systems creates their behavior and performance.
> * Understand how well-meant policies or decisions often inadvertently create (business) performance issues, rather than solve them.




## Business applications:
>
> Useful applications of System Dynamics :
> * **Business Strategy and Decision-Making:**
>
> Using system dynamics, businesses can model various scenarios, anticipating potential unintended consequences of their decisions. 
> For example, companies can simulate the impact of new policies on operations, finances, and market growth over time.
> 
> * **Supply Chain Management:** 
>
> System dynamics is particularly useful for supply chain management, where delays, oscillations, and feedback loops often affect performance. 
> Businesses can model supply chains to optimize inventory, minimize delays, and manage demand fluctuations, ultimately reducing costs and improving efficiency.
> 
> * **Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR:**
> 
> Companies can use system dynamics to evaluate their sustainability strategies, ensuring long-term viability while aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
> This is especially relevant in industries with significant environmental or social impacts.
>
> * **Policy Design and Risk Management::**
> 
> Businesses can simulate what-if scenarios to test the effectiveness of various policies or strategies under different conditions.
> This helps in developing more resilient policies that account for uncertainties and dynamic changes, reducing risks associated with strategic decisions.
> 
> * **Market Dynamics and Competition**
> 
> Firms can use the modeling techniques to study competitive dynamics within their industry, predict competitor behavior, and adjust their strategies accordingly. 
> This helps in positioning products, entering new markets, or even anticipating market shifts.
> 
>  * **Innovation and Product Development**
> 
> System dynamics modeling allows companies to simulate the life cycle of new products, from development to market penetration. 
> It can help in understanding the impact of innovation strategies on long-term growth and market share.
>
>  * **Operations Management**
>
> System dynamics can optimize internal processes, such as production planning, resource allocation, and workforce management, by simulating the effects of various operational strategies.
